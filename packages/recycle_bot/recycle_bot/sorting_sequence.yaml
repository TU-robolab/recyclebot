# YAML defining sorting target locations, neutral pose, and camera transform
# defined as a conjunction of a position and orientation in reference to base_link:
# - position: cartesian coordinates (mm for poses, meters for transforms)
# - orientation: quaternion [x, y, z, w]

# camera transform: static transform from base to camera_link (meters)
# used for projecting detections into robot frame
camera_transform:
  parent_frame: "base"
  child_frame: "camera_link"
  translation: [-0.384, 0.286, 0.624]  # meters
  rotation: [-0.999, 0.045, 0.0, 0.0]  # quaternion [x, y, z, w]

# neutral pose: safe position above workspace for transit between pick and place
# robot moves here after gripping before moving to place location
neutral_pose:
  position: [300.0, 0.0, 400.0]  # centered, elevated (mm)
  orientation: [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # face-down (180° around Y)

# sorting bin locations
sorting_sequence:
  - target_bin_1: { position: [393.43, -247.56, 1.24], orientation: [0.187876, -0.6345103, -0.7318231, 0.1628935] }
#  - target_bin_2: { position: [x2, y2, z2], orientation: [qx2, qy2, qz2, qw2] }
#  - target_bin_3: { position: [x3, y3, z3], orientation: [qx3, qy3, qz3, qw3] }

cycle: true  # cycle through targets when end is reached
