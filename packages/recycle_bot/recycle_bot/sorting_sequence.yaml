# YAML defining sorting target locations and neutral pose
# defined as a conjunction of a position and orientation in reference to base_link:
# - position: cartesian coordinates (meters) - consistent with MoveIt
# - orientation: quaternion [x, y, z, w]

# neutral pose: safe position above workspace for transit between pick and place
# robot moves here after gripping before moving to place location
neutral_pose:
  position: [0.3, 0.0, 0.4]  # centered, elevated (meters)
  orientation: [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # face-down (180° around Y)

# sorting bin locations
sorting_sequence:
  - target_bin_1: { position: [0.39343, -0.24756, 0.00124], orientation: [0.187876, -0.6345103, -0.7318231, 0.1628935] }
#  - target_bin_2: { position: [x2, y2, z2], orientation: [qx2, qy2, qz2, qw2] }
#  - target_bin_3: { position: [x3, y3, z3], orientation: [qx3, qy3, qz3, qw3] }

cycle: true  # cycle through targets when end is reached
