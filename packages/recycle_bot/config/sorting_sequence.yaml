# YAML defining sorting target locations and neutral pose
# defined as a conjunction of a position and orientation in reference to base_link:
# - position: cartesian coordinates (meters) - consistent with MoveIt
# - orientation: quaternion [x, y, z, w]

# neutral pose: safe position above workspace for transit between pick and place
# robot moves here after gripping before moving to place location
